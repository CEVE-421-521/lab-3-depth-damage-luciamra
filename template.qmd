# Site information

This is an analysis of the Fisherman's Wharf at 2200 Harborside Dr, Galveston using data from the 8771450 Galveston Pier 21, TX guage. This building is "near" the water guage as it is located right off of the pier where the guage is placed.
Building Elevation: 3.74 ft

```{julia}
haz_fl_dept = CSV.read("data/haz_fl_dept.csv", DataFrame)
include("depthdamage.jl")
```

# Depth-Damage

Depth-Damage Function: USACE-Galveston Cafeteria Restaurant, Structure
I am using this as the depth damage function because the building I am analyzing fits under the classification of a restaurant. More importantly, it is in Galveston, so in order to accurately represent water levels in the area, I have to use a function that is based off of this geographical location.

```{julia}
row = @rsubset(
    haz_fl_dept, :Description == "Cafeteria Restaurant, structure"
)[
    1,:,
]
dd = DepthDamageData(row)
```

```{julia}
fieldnames(typeof(dd))
```

```{julia}
scatter(
    dd.depths,
    dd.damages;
    xlabel="Flood Depth at Building",
    ylabel="Damage (%)",
    label="$(dd.description) ($(dd.source))",
    legend=:bottomright,
    size=(700, 500),
)
```

```{julia}
itp = let
    depth_ft = ustrip.(u"ft", dd.depths)
    damage_frac = dd.damages
    Interpolations.LinearInterpolation(
        depth_ft,
        damage_frac;
        extrapolation_bc=Interpolations.Flat(),
    )
end
```

```{julia}
let
    dmg_fn(x) = itp(ustrip.(u"ft", x))
    dmg_fn.([3.1u"ft", 2.2u"m", 91.4u"inch"])
end
```

```{julia}
function get_depth_damage_function(
    depth_train::Vector{<:T}, dmg_train::Vector{<:AbstractFloat}
) where {T<:Unitful.Length}

    # interpolate
    depth_ft = ustrip.(u"ft", depth_train)
    interp_fn = Interpolations.LinearInterpolation(
        depth_ft,
        dmg_train;
        extrapolation_bc=Interpolations.Flat(),
    )

    damage_fn = function (depth::T2) where {T2<:Unitful.Length}
        return interp_fn(ustrip.(u"ft", depth))
    end
    return damage_fn
end
```

```{julia}
damage_fn = get_depth_damage_function(dd.depths, dd.damages)
```

```{julia}
p = let
    depths = uconvert.(u"ft", (-7.0u"ft"):(1.0u"inch"):(30.0u"ft"))
    damages = damage_fn.(depths)
    scatter(
        depths,
        damages;
        xlabel="Flood Depth",
        ylabel="Damage (%)",
        label="$(dd.description) ($(dd.source))",
        legend=:bottomright,
        size=(800, 400),
        linewidth=2,
    )
end
p
```

This curve is plotted in 1 inch increments from -10 to 30 feet. This graph represents an estimation of the amount of damage that a building will experience given a certain flood depth. Plotting this at 1 inch increments provides a detailed graph with the estimated damage for every inch of water rise that can be more generally used for depths that are in between foot measurments.

# Expected annual damages

```{julia}
gauge_dist = GeneralizedExtremeValue(5, 1.5, 0.1)
```

```{julia}
p1 = plot(
    gauge_dist;
    label="Gauge Distribution",
    xlabel="Water Level (ft)",
    ylabel="Probability Density",
    legend=:topright,
    linewidth=2,
)
```

```{julia}
offset = 3.74 # building is 3.74 feet above gauge
house_dist = GeneralizedExtremeValue(gauge_dist.μ - offset, gauge_dist.σ, gauge_dist.ξ)
```

```{julia}
plot!(p1, house_dist; label="House Distribution", linewidth=2)
```

```{julia}
using Random
```

The following is known as a Monte Carlo Algorithm, which is estimating the expected annual damages based on 1,000,000 samples. This algorithm randomly takes samples of hazard from a distribution, the vale

```{julia}
N=1000000
sample = rand(house_dist, N) .* 1.0u"ft"
result = damage_fn.(sample)
mean(result)
```
